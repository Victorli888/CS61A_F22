"""
Why is this method so take so long to calculate fibby(35)?
The way this method is computed follows a recursive tree and repeats calls that have
already been done. For example calling fibby(5) calls fibby(4) & fibby(3) and both of
those will call fibby(2). This becomes taxing when we have large calls like fibby(35)
